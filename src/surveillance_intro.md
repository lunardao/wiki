# Introduction

The following entries about surveillance programs focuses both on the past and the present. This is a fragment of all information available, and even less if considering the surveillance measures by nation-states and corporations. We are not aiming to present in depth articles on these programs. The intention is to build an understanding for what surveillance measures are existing which can inform us directions in regards to privacy knowledge and tools. [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org/) have extensive materials on surveillance programs and for anyone interested to learn more, we'd recommend to read the materials shared there.
