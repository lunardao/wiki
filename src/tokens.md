# LunarDAO Tokens

**LUNAR**

* LunarDAO community token
* Token Contract: *Testnet:* https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x147c0ed8DB89Ca1f4f8c850F358582D29C9A326D#code
* Total supply = 1,000,000,000
* 40% of total supply sold in Genesis event
* Read about distribution in [Genesis event](./genesis_event.md) and sub-categories
* Every holder of $LUNAR is a LunarDAO community member
* $LUNAR staked for 7 days and more gives voting power

**VOX**

* LunarDAO governance token
* Token Contract: *Testnet:* https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xC7D8C0bCAF73A65acad85edeb6Bd4cea2242Ab6a#code
* An Account Bound Token representing number of votes of its holder
* 1 $VOX gets minted when 1000 $LUNAR staked for one year
* The smallest time period to mint $VOX is 7 days (see [Staking rewards](./lunar_staking.md) and Table 5)
* A community member holding a minimum of $100 of $VOX (counted in 7 days staking ratio) becomes a Squad member (read [Governance](./governance.md))
* When unstaking $LUNAR: $VOX of the same ratio is burned
* The DAO can decide on other benefits based on $VOX ownership
* Can be used as a "white-list" for any events decided by the LunarDAO 
	* ie when [Raise & Investment - option 2](./launchpad.md) event takes place, $VOX holders have a priority

**T**

* Not a LunarDAO token: A variable representing tokens of a supported project X
* Different T tokens will accumulate in the treasury as more projects get supported
