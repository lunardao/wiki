# Research

The Research committee conveys research about privacy and anonymity projects and tools. This research can serve as a basis for evaluation of investment LIPs for the DAO and as a resource for the community. Community members can [post on the forum](https://forum.lunardao.net/) if they want to join the Research committee.
