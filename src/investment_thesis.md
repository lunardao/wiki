# Investment thesis

[LunarDAO](https://lunardao.net/) is an INVESTMENT FUND INTO PRIVACY PROJECTS & ANONYMITY TOOLING, a squad wealth based DAO spreading [Lunarpunk narrative and philosophy](https://wiki.lunardao.net/).

Anonymity and privacy oriented developers will face an increasing difficulty in finding support among traditional VC's and investment funds, because of regulatory measures. This will lead into a dynamic where the developing teams will be forced to sell their work underpriced to counterparties who don't share the same vision. An outcome will be a cycle where privacy is taboo, developers are under stress and value is extracted from the ecosystem.

The prospect does not have to be so grim. The future of privacy can be ultimately bullish. LunarDAO offers a solution.

We form a decentralized squad of sovereign individuals, lunarpunks, to allocate resources together and assemble squad wealth. The DAO leverages the collective power and becomes an investor. The community discuss which tools are needed to empower the ecosystem, research committee evaluates the teams developing them and the Squad members democratically decide which projects shall be supported.

- The privacy projects will get suported by an anonymous hydra, an investment organism not bowing to the regulations.  
- The teams will have the needed resources to develop, grow and deliver.  
- LunarDAO treasury accumulate supported privacy assets and the Squad manages the funds as a common portfolio.  
- The value is conserved in the ecosystem.  
- While leveraging collective power, every individual is protected against majority rule and can exit the DAO any time with 100% of their shares (without any fee).

## Knowledge as a Value

The investment sphere is LunarDAO's main focus and at the same time we see education as foundational to be able to fulfill our mission.

The DAO creates possibilities for technical literacy by building [research](https://wiki.lunardao.net/anoma.html) and [wiki](https://wiki.lunardao.net/intro.html) and supporting [educational structures](./academy_intro.md) such as the partnering project [Adalan Academy](https://adalanacademy.org), where people can acquire knowledge and master skills in programming and economy while developing a philosophical frame to generate the future path of lunarpunk ecosystem. Such education empowers the community and shape thinkers who bring the value back to the ecosystem.
