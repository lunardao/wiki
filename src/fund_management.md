# Fund Management

LunarDAO makes investments in privacy projects through the governance process, which includes research, discussion, proposals and voting. The Squad allocates funds to selected teams while building a treasury of its investments. There are several ways how to approach treasury management and govern the funds. For easier understanding we summarized them under two main types: ***Portfolio*** (or Investment club) and ***Syndicate***. These two approaches are explained with examples below. 

**After the genesis event (LunarDAO launch) the default approach to fund management is *PORTFOLIO*.** However the Squad can decide to create separated guilds. To prevent disadvantage of old members' investment dilution, a bonding curve of 10% $VOX price increase is introduced for every new raise event. In the case of a Squad disapproval of opening a new fundraising event (to prevent dilution of past investments) and existing community wish and incentive to join the DAO, a subDAO can be established for the new raise building a separated treasury. In such scenario the different subDAOs manage their own treasuries and their management is based on the SYNDICATE model.

The following table explains these two concepts.

*Table 1: Fundamental approaches: Portfolio & Syndicate*

| **FUND MANAGEMENT – Design Essentials** | **Portfolio/ investment club**  | **Syndicate** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Description: | All the assets in the treasury are pooled together as a common portfolio. Each $VOX despite the time of purchase represents the same value (1 $VOX = treasury asset net value / # $VOX ). The Squad members can start different sub-DAOs or specific guilds just like in the “Syndicate” option. | Each fundraising cycle (or even each individual deal) is a separated entity in a separated subDAO. The investments or raising cycles can be separated into sub-DAOs or guilds or alternatively tokens representing the past investments are minted based on on-chain snapshot taken at the time of the investment. |
| Exposure to the past investments:                           | Yes. New members are exposed to the old investments. | No, new members aren’t part of the portfolio of the past, only to the future investments. |
| Aim of LunarDAO launch raise size (minimum, aim, maximum):  | 700 ETH, 7000 ETH, 15000 ETH (if hit, the smart contract expires). | *As Portfolio* |
| How often LunarDAO runs a raise event:                      | Default: 4x the first year. An investment deal is expected to happen before any next raise. After the initial one, the formed Squad can propose to cap (# ETH) for the next raise or make a sub-DAO and switch into the *syndicate* option. Every sub-DAO makes autonomus decisions on this question. | This case happens if the Squad decides to separate to subDAOs. 4x the first year. Before any next raising event a new separated sub-DAO is opened for the new members who will manage funds separately from the other subDAOs. Every sub-DAO makes autonomus decisions and can futher continue as *portfolio* style managed DAO. |
| How often the LunarDAO opens for new Squad members:         | Every raising event. If the Squad votes against new fundraising events while there is a strong community wish to join the DAO, a new subDAO fundraising can be opened -> switch to *syndicate* option. | *As Portfolio* |
| Condition to join LunarDAO Squad at launch:                 | Permissionless with a minimum tribute. | LunarDAO launches as *Portfolio* fund. Conditions to join future subDAOs will be discussed with the community. |
| Condition to join LunarDAO Squad in the future:             | Default stays the same (except $VOX price - read below). The initial Squad will has a right to decide whether to keep the permissionless setup, introduce invites, raise the minimum tribute bar, limit the max Squad members or max ETH size etc. | New *syndicate* sub-DAOs are permissionless. |
| Minimum tribute on launch | 0.1 ETH (10 $VOX). Tribute must be a multiplier of 0.1 ETH. | LunarDAO launches as portfolio based fund. |
| On-boarding contract design:                                | Contract is opened for a limited period. $VOX (shares) are minted based on members' tribute. If the maximum raise threshold is met the contract expires, no more tributes can be submitted. | *As Portfolio*                                      |
| On-boarding contract expiry period (1st one/ any next one): | 2 weeks the first raise/ 1 week any other one. | Launch is portfolio type/ the future ones to be decided. |
| $VOX (shares) price on launch:                              | 1 ETH = 100 $VOX - 0.25% admin/management fee. Each $VOX in the given fundraising period has the same price (every Squad member has an equal entry price). | *As Portfolio* |
| $VOX value calculation:                                     | 1 $VOX = LunarDAO net value / # of $VOX in existence | Same formula for each subDAO |
| $VOX (shares) price bonding curve:                          | + 10% each next funding cycle. The squad can evaluate otherwise. | The new members do not have access to the past investments, only the net value of the new treasury. There is no bonding curve. $VOX has the same price like on launch. |
| $VOX-loot price calculation:                                | Owners $VOX-loot value = owners $VOX (shares) value, without voting power (in the time of GuildKick). Including owners access to the future allocations which are part of the RageQuited treasury. | *As Portfolio* |
| Squad membership:                                           | Everyone owning at least 1 $VOX is a Squad member. Squad members have voting power. | Everyone owning at least 1 $VOX is a Squad member, however members can vote on treasury decisions only in the guilds/ sub-DAOs in which their $VOX (shares) are allocated. |
| Overall governance changes: | Discussion -> LIP -> vote -> implementation | All the sub-DAOs together and counted as one DAO with vote event. Every 1 $VOX = 1 vote. |
| Management/admin fee: | Entry: 0.25% from each tribute, 0.5% per each investment execution from the treasury. | Same like portfolio, but per each subDAO separately as raising events and investment executions happen in different times and sizes. |
| Further operational expenses: | LIP is submitted and voted upon. | LIP is submitted and voted upon. Two options: a) Divided budget proposals to each sub-DAO, based on their ETH weight (SUM(proposed ETH \* sub_DAO ETH / all sub-DAOS ETH total)). b) One proposal to sub-DAOs combined into one DAO. Vote power is calculated from the proposed asset weight from different subDAOs and their members -> SUM(asset weight \* # $VOX). If agreed, the payment is sent proportionally to the token weights of the subDAOs and its members. |

*Portfolio* and *Syndicate* fund management options are explained below, including examples.
