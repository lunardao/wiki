# Sentinels

Builders and teams in our ecosystem of privacy oriented projects are often public, using known pseudonyms, and are recognized in crypto communities. In ['Why anon'](https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html) we explained why anonymity and privacy are not only important for lunarpunk movement, but also the only choice for the [Stewards](./stewards.md) (core team/ founders) of LunarDAO.

To build trust, and decentralize, the DAO is collborating with six Sentinels who are not core-members. The Sentinels are:

**Steward Anon 2**

These are guidelines to support Sentinels in their responsibility. It is the responsibility of the whole community to support the governance process, in which the forum discussion is an essential part. This ensures democratic governance and gives opportunities for feedback on proposals before initiating voting. Through the LIP process, if LunarDAO Community and Squad members have expressed criticisms and evaluated a proposal to be non-aligned with community sentiment or otherwise unsupported, the author should consider re-writing the LIP or decide to not proceed with voting.
