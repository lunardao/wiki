### Can I contribute to the DAO anonymously?
Yes. It is recommended. Follow this
[guide](./anonymizing_assets.md).

### Does it matter whether I'm anonymous or not?

LunarDAO is focused on privacy-preserving projects. This ethos impacts
how you should participate in the DAO. Privacy techniques are strongly
encouraged when interacting with the DAO.  Each piece of information
that a user gives up degrades their privacy. Achieving anonymity on a
transparent chain is extremely difficult.  Privacy degradation stems from:

- Doxxed addresses
- Network leaks
- Side channel attacks

LunarDAO participants should solve for all of these threats.

### I have nothing to hide.

>*â€œArguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."*

### How do I apply for funding from LunarDAO?

A LunarDAO Squad member is every community member with $100 worth of
VOX. Proposals are made via LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal). This
includes investment proposals, new standards, and funding proposals.

Only squad members are eligible to submit a LIP. Read more in [grant
application](./grant_application.md).

### What is LunarDAO?

The moon symbolizes many things, including transformation, life,
strength and power. Life itself means continuous transformation. Life
that is stagnant, that conforms, will cease to exist.

Lunarpunk is the emergence of a great forest that is continually expanding
against surveillance society. LunarDAO is a part of this forest. It was
born out of necessity. The shifting tides of regulation have forced us to
focus on improving our defenses.

We constituted LunarDAO because we believe in community, decentralization,
individual responsibility and contribution to a common mission. LunarDAO
is a community directed by Lunar Squad. It is a practical application
of the lunarpunk vision.

### What are the aims of LunarDAO?

1. Enable parallel confederated societies that are diverse and autonomous
but mutually protect each other against central authority.

2. Learn, educate, share knowledge. Education is fundamental in our
struggle for free life, autonomy, and community.

3. Develop infrastructure for economy and politics beyond the state,
that is uncensorable, sovereign and anonymous. Expand the dark forest.

### How can I join?

Anyone can become a part of LunarDAO Community by acquiring LUNAR. LUNAR
does not give voting rights, but owning LUNAR enables you to participate
in community discussions and contribute to the development of the DAO.

Read more about [governance](./governance.md) to know
the structure and focus of the DAO. This document also explains how to
sumbit an LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal) and participate in voting.

### How are decisions made in LunarDAO?

Proposals concerning changes in governance, guidelines, as well as
investment and fundraising are made through the LIP process. There is
a template in [LIP](./lip-0001.md). Voting
is done through Snapshot.

However, LunarDAO governance is not limited to LIPs or Snapshot
voting. Decisions flow upward from the community. Voting in LunarDAO
is the practical implementation of the willpower of the community. The
decision making process is not something technical and cannot be separated
from our communication and interaction on the forum.

LunarDAO values discussion and diversity of opinions. We believe this will
aid the development of a truly decentralized, anonymous and antifragile
organization.

### What is LUNAR & VOX?

LunarDAO governance tokens:

**LUNAR**

- Everyone who holds $LUNAR is a part of LunarDAO Community.
- You can stake $LUNAR to acquire $VOX, the LunarDAO governance token.
- Through staking $LUNAR you can provide liquidity and earn rewards. Read
more about Lunar staking [here](./lunar_staking.md).

**VOX**

- $VOX is LunarDAO's governance token.
- You can only acquire it by staking $LUNAR.
- $VOX is burned when $LUNAR is unstaked.
- If you have $100 worth of VOX (calculated in 7 days staking ratio)
you are a LunarDAO Squad member and can submit LIP's and vote.

You can read more in [LunarDAO token](./tokens.md).

### How do I buy tokens?

LunarDAO runs a Protocol Owned Liquidity which serves as a pool for
trading $LUNAR. More info soon.

### How does staking work?

* 50% of all $LUNAR emission are allocated as staking rewards. Those
are every 24h divided between all staked LUNAR tokens (their holders
proportionally).
* Non-vested staking pool allows for $LUNAR holders to stake and unstake
at anytime and earn the given APR.
* Locked Staking Pools: receive $VOX and a higher APR. $LUNAR tokens
can be locked in pools from 7 days to 2 years.
* The longer period of staking, the more $VOX is received, and the
higher the APR ratio. Locking $LUNAR decreased the amount of $LUNAR in
circulation and increases the price.

*Staking rewards ratio by time locking period*

| **Staking Pool** | **$VOX / 1000 $LUNAR** | **Staking reward ratio** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 days | 0 | 1 |
| 7 days | 0.02 | 2 |
| 30 days | 0.08 | 5 |
| 90 days | 0.25 | 10 |
| 180 days | 0.5 | 20 |
| 365 days | 1 | 45 |
| 2 years | 2 | 100 |

### What are the committees?

Committees in LunarDAO are sub-groups within the community that aim to
facilitate specific tasks needed by the DAO.
The committees presented below are considered fundamental to the DAO.

- **Stewards** guides the foundational works of the DAO, and among other things 
coordinate operations and project investment, make sure everyone knows about 
voting and implement decisions. Initially Stewards include founding members.

- **Media committee** is responsible to update the web page, twitter, and mdbook, 
coordinate and intiate media works according to needs and LunarDAO aims.

- **Research committee** conduct research about privacy project which can 
serve as a basis for LIP to support projects, and as a resource for the community.

- **Education committee** coordinate the support of educational 
projects with aim to share knowledge and skills in a decentralized way. 
New Moon Academy will be in the forefront of this work, with online educations in 
programming, economics and political philosophy. 

- **Sentinels** a group of eight multi-sig. Five is needed to execute 
Lunar Squad decisions. Sentinels also have the possibility to reject malicious proposals.

At any point new committees can be proposed or existing ones can be
archived should the community deem this necessary (through LIP and
voting). The committee autonomously decides who can join. In every
committee there is one person responsible for communication, who can be
contacted if a member want to get involved.

The committee decides its own work flow and formulates the goals of the
committee. All committees give information about their tasks in LunarDAO
community meetings and are receptive to input and criticisms. Every three
months each committee will sumbit a report to the community detailing
what has been done. The community evaluates the work of a committee
every 12 months.

Read the full description of the committees responsibilities in [Governance](./governance.md).
