### Can I contribute to the DAO anonymously?
Yes. It is recommended. Follow this
[guide](./anonymizing_assets.md).

### Does it matter whether I'm anonymous or not?

LunarDAO is focused on privacy-preserving projects. This ethos impacts how you should participate in the DAO. Privacy techniques are strongly encouraged when interacting with the DAO.  Each piece of information that a user gives up degrades their privacy. Achieving anonymity on a
transparent chain is extremely difficult. Privacy degradation stems from:

- Doxxed addresses  
- Network leaks  
- Side channel attacks

LunarDAO participants should solve for all of these threats.

### I have nothing to hide.

### How do I apply for funding from LunarDAO?

A LunarDAO Squad member is any community member who owns $VOX/Shares. The Squad can submit proposals including ie.investment proposals and changes on gorvernance. These are made via LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal). Road more about this process in [Governance](https://github.com/lunardao/dao#governance) and [LIP-0001](./lip-0001.md).

### What is LunarDAO?

LunarDAO is an investment fund based on lunarpunk philosophy. By allocating funds in privacy projects & anonymity tooling we aim to expand freedom and ensure sovereignty. Squad wealth leverages collective strength and capture value in the ecosystem by building a portfolio of privacy assets. Anyone can exit at any time. Members are anonymous hence can participate in building this vision without fear of frozen funds, legal implications or any kind of repression. We aim to move to a full anon setup and develop infrastructure for a parallel economy outside of control and centralization.

### What are the aims of LunarDAO?

1. Enable parallel confederated societies that are diverse and autonomous but mutually protect each other against central authority.

2. Learn, educate, share knowledge. Education is fundamental in our struggle for free life, autonomy, and community.

3. Develop infrastructure for economy and politics beyond the state, that is uncensorable, sovereign and anonymous. Expand the dark forest.

### How can I join?

During fundraising event, anyone who buy $VOX can become a Squad member. The minimum tribute is 0.1 ETH. $VOX represent the member's share of the treasury as well as voting power. LunarDAO Squad members can exit the DAO with their funds at any time through ragequit. Read more on governance [here](https://github.com/lunardao/dao#governance).

### How are decisions made in LunarDAO?

LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal) is the basis of governance in LunarDAO. Squad members can submit and vote on proposals. In [LIP-0001](./lip-0001.md) there is a template and further information on the expected content and process. Voting should be announced at least 7 days ahead of time and voting shall be open for 72h. The proposal is approved if 50% + 1 $VOX vote yes, else it is rejected. It can also be rejected if Sentinels deem the proposal to be malicious. Voting is followed by the Grace period, during which Squad members can ragequit should they disagree with the result of the voting.

However, LunarDAO governance is not limited to LIPs or 
voting. Decisions flow upward from the community. Voting in LunarDAO is the practical implementation of the willpower of the community. The decision making process is not something technical and cannot be separated from our communication and interaction on the forum.

LunarDAO values discussion and diversity of opinions. We believe this will aid the development of a truly decentralized, anonymous and anti-fragile organization.

### What is VOX?

**VOX**

In LunarDAO Shares are represented by the symbol $VOX.

- 1 $VOX is an equivalent to 1 share.  
- $VOX is LunarDAO governance token.  
- Minimum of 1 $VOX grants Squad membership and voting power.  
- $VOX is an account bound, non-transferable token.  
- Every 0.1 ETH of tribute to treasury mints 10 $VOX to the member (at launch, future entry price may differ based on the previous investments made).  
- When a member ragequit, $VOX is burned.  
    - $VOX value in the treasury stays the same for remaining members.  
    - Ragequitting member gets 100% of their funds in the form of loot.

### How do I buy tokens?

- A fundraising event is proposed to take place 4x in the first year. (every third month).*  
- An investment deal is expected to happen at least once before between each fundraisiong event.*  
- If there are still unused ETH (or DAI) from the previous raise, the number of fundraising events or max cap of such event will be adjusted to this reality. *  
- The fundraising is open two weeks the first time, and thereafter a week on each occation.*  
During this time anyone can become a Squad member by tributing ETH to the treasury.*  
-  Minimum tribute is 0.1 ETH.

### What are the committees?

Committees in LunarDAO are groups within the community that aim to facilitate and coordinate the works of the DAO according to their specific focus. The committees presented below were chosen during the intial development because they are fundamental to the DAO. At any point, after the launch, new committees can be proposed or an existing one can be archived if the community deems it's needed (this operation is also done through LIP and voting).

The committees autonomously decide who can join. In every committee there is one person responsible for communication, who can be contacted if a member wants to get engaged. The committees decide their own work flow and formulate expectations, objectives and key results within the committee.

All committees give information about the ongoing works in the community meetings and are receptive to input and criticisms. Every three months each committee will submit a report to the community about the ongoing works.

**Stewards**

LunarDAO Stewards (LunarDAO core team) is a committee dedicated to support and guide the essential works of the DAO. Initially, at launch, they include founding members of the DAO. The number of Stewards should not be less than three and no more than ten. The LunarDAO Stewards responsibilities includes, but are not limited to:

- Operations  
- Administration  
- Community management  
- Information: Making sure all other DAO members are aware of proposals and are notified in time to be able to participate in voting  
- Implementation of community decisions  
- Investment communication & coordination  
- Media & Presentation  
- Partnerships & Networking  
- Legal advice coordination

**How to become a Steward**

To become a Steward any Squad member can make a proposal and contact one of the [forum moderators](https://forum.lunardao.net/t/welcome-to-lunardao/7). The proposal can include interests, experiences as well as expected level of commitment within the DAO. The proposition will be discussed among existing Stewards. They will also take into consideration ideas and suggestions which can support LunarDAO mission as well as initiatives and activity of the member within the community. The Stewards may also make a call out for new Stewards if additional support is needed.

**Media**

The Media committee is responsible for updating the web page and twitter. The media output is in accordance with LunarDAO mission, decisions and development. The committee can also coordinate and recruit members for media productions based on LunarDAOs mission and goals, participate in interviews or initiate media works that are beneficial to the DAO. Community members can post on the [forum](https://forum.lunardao.net/) if they want to join the Media committee.

**Research**

The Research committee conveys research about privacy and anonymity projects and tools. This research can serve as a basis for evaluation of investment LIPs for the DAO and as a resource for the community. Community members can post on the [forum](https://forum.lunardao.net/) if they want to join the Research committee.

**Education**

Education is fundamental in the struggle for free life, autonomy, and community. It is vital to train guides by providing knowledge, skills and build confidence. LunarDAO is in a trust based partnership with Adalan Academy and aim to support their development. The initial focus of this decentralized virtual academy is to offer courses in programming, economics and political philosophy. Some of the outcomes are creation and translation of education material, texts and resources. The long-term objective is being able to educate the new generation of lunarpunks.

An essential part of education, and included in the roadmap, is collecting, researching and sharing tools and resources that are privacy oriented. This includes creating opt out manuals that provide the means to exit surveillance society and develop parallel structures that are decentralized and expands our freedom.

**Sentinels**

LunarDAO Sentinels is a committee responsible for executing community decisions in regards to treasury (multi-sig) and consists of eight members in total. Sentinels can reject a malicious proposal even if it has been approved by the community. Five are needed to execute a decision.

The suggested time frame to be a multi-sig participant is two years. The transfer will happen when there is someone who can take over when the time is due and is not a rigid measurement. To rotate responsibilities to new Sentinels supports a level of diversity of thought in this important governance responsibility.

*A malicious proposal can include:*

- Proposals which are harmful to LunarDAO mission and goals.  
- Proposals which are supporting centralization and hegemony.  
- Proposals which are supporting surveillance projects or measures.  
- Proposals which are supporting regulatory measures.  
- Proposal which are suspected of/or exposed as having malintent ie. a quickly pushed proposals which aims to drain the treasury.

These are guidelines to support Sentinels in their responsibility. It is the responsibility of the whole community to support the governance process, in which the forum discussion is an essential part. This ensures democratic governance and gives opportunities for feedback on proposals before initiating voting. Through the LIP process, if LunarDAO Community and Squad members have expressed criticisms and evaluated a proposal to be non-aligned with community sentiment or otherwise unsupported, the author should consider re-writing the LIP or decide to not proceed with voting.

As a part of the roadmap; the squad will vote if to continue to have a multi-sig based treasury or move to a complete trustless setup.

Builders and teams in our ecosystem of privacy oriented projects are often public, using known pseudonyms, and are recognized in crypto communities. In 'Why anon' we explained why anonymity and privacy are not only important for lunarpunk movement, but also the only choice for the Stewards (core team/ founders) of LunarDAO.

To build trust, and decentralize, the DAO is collborating with six Sentinels who are not core-members.
