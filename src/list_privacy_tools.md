# List of privacy tools

As efforts on decentralization, privacy and zero-knowledge cryptography constantly develop, we should not see privacy and distribution as a goal in a distant future. LunarDAO aims to see what tools and possibilities are there here and now. As a community of Lunarpunks we have the ability to compile a solid pool of resources, links, manuals which constantly evolves. It is import for everyone to make their own evaluation of these projects privacy standard and make an informed decision what to use based on that.

## Private network layer

- [**I2P**](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro)  
Is an encrypted private network layer. The traffic inside I2P does not interact with the internet directly, it is a layer on top of the Internet. I2P protects activity, no one can see the origin, destination, or contents of the data. It is a peer-to-peer network and if the user want to protect their IP address they also need to use a VPN while using I2P.

## MAC address randomization

Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet connections all use MAC addresses (Media Access Control Address). MAC addresses are always a 12 digit hexadecimal number, with the numbers separated every two digits by a colon or hyphen. MAC addresses are used to identify which device is which on users local network. Because theyâ€™re unique, MAC addresses can be used to track a user. When walking around, a smartphone scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and broadcasts its MAC address. For better privacy it is good to learn how to change the MAC address. Here are three pages which addresses this issue:

- [**Android developers**](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html)  

- [**GrapheneOS**](https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-security)  
Read more under 'Secure android phone'.  

- [**Cyberithub**](https://www.cyberithub.com/how-to-change-the-mac-address-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-macchanger/)  
A guide on how to install macchanger on Debian based OS and how to change the mac address manually (the random changes during testing didn't work so far, but doing it manually works well).

## IMEI randomization

### Banana phone

IMEI stands for [International Mobile Equipment Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity). It is a unique numeric identifier of GSM, or 3GPP and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones.

**IMEI randomization**: Nokia "Banana" phone (Nokia 8110) has different ways to be hacked for IMEI randomization. The most simple way is to install [**Wallace Toolbox**](https://gitlab.com/suborg/wallace-toolbox/-/archive/master/wallace-toolbox-master.zip).

- [**Random IMEI generator**](https://randommer.io/imei-generator)

- Installing [**Gerda OS**](https://gerda.tech/#h1.4_install) on Nokia 8110 for improved usability.

## Secure android phone

- [**Graphene OS**](https://grapheneos.org/) on a Google pixel phone (from 4 and up, less than are no longer maintained). Note that not all Google pixel  
Graphene OS is completely without Google apps and also automatically randomizes [**MAC address**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address). There is [**F-Droid**](https://f-droid.org/en/) instead of app store. other useful and secure apps for this set up (some also mentioned in other sections): [**Session**](https://getsession.org/), [**Signal**](https://www.signal.org/), or  [**Element**](https://element.io/) as messenger app, [**Fennec**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) for browsing, [**Bitmask**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/se.leap.bitmaskclient/) or [**ProtonVPN**](https://protonvpn.com/download) for VPN services and [**Tor browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/) for onion routing, [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) as an ad-free youtube-like app, [**Markor**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) to be able to write Markdown docs which also can be used on computer, [**Insular**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.oasisfeng.island.fdroid/), which creates an island and isolates this space from the rest of your phone. On the island you can have apps which have security issues which can be downloaded with [**Aurora app**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/) store. It is recommended to not use a SIM card for the phone to be secure. A number can instead be obtained (and payed with crypto) on [**jmp.chat**](https://jmp.chat/).
