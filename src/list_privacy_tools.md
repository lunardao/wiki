# List of privacy tools

As efforts on decentralization, privacy and zero-knowledge cryptography constantly develop, we should not see privacy and distribution as a goal in a distant future. LunarDAO aims to see what tools and possibilities are there here and now. As a community of Lunarpunks we have the ability to compile a solid pool of resources, links, manuals which constantly evolves. It is import for everyone to make their own evaluation of these projects privacy standard and make an informed decision what to use based on that.

## Private network layer

- [**I2P**](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro)  
Is an encrypted private network layer. The traffic inside I2P does not interact with the internet directly, it is a layer on top of the Internet. I2P protects activity, no one can see the origin, destination, or contents of the data. It is a peer-to-peer network and if the user want to protect their IP address they also need to use a VPN while using I2P.

## MAC address randomization

Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet connections all use MAC addresses (Media Access Control Address). MAC addresses are always a 12 digit hexadecimal number, with the numbers separated every two digits by a colon or hyphen. MAC addresses are used to identify which device is which on users local network. Because they’re unique, MAC addresses can be used to track a user. When walking around, a smartphone scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and broadcasts its MAC address. For better privacy it is good to learn how to change the MAC address. Here are three pages which addresses this issue:

- [**Android developers**](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html)  

- [**GrapheneOS**](https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-security)  
Read more under 'Secure android phone'.  

- [**Cyberithub**](https://www.cyberithub.com/how-to-change-the-mac-address-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-macchanger/)

## IMEI randomization

### Banana phone

IMEI stands for [International Mobile Equipment Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity). It is a unique numeric identifier of GSM, or 3GPP and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones.
