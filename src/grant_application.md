# Grant application

Any proposal within LunarDAO; standard or investment is done via LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal). This includes any project applying for grants from LunarDAO.
A LunarDAO Squad member: a community member with $100 VOX or more (calculated in 7 days staking ratio) can submit a LIP.

## Process

- Create a LIP (LunarDAO Improvement proposal) using template in LIP-0001
- Create a thread on the forum, where you also share the LIP
- Discuss the proposal with the community
- If there is support, develop the proposal taking into consideration the given feedback. 
- Update the LIP with edited version on the forum and discuss with the commmuniy to get feedback if the proposal at this point resonates with the community
- If there is support for the LIP, announce the Snapshot voting a minimum of 7 days beforehand.
- Voting is done with Snapshot and lasts for 48 hours
- If 50% + 1 $VOX or more (of total amount of VOX which is participating in voting) accepts the proposal --> multi-sig execution
- If less than 50% + $1 VOX accepts or the proposal is deemed malicious --> rejection


## Mutual growth

The volume of the support by LunarDAO represents the conviction the community have in the project. The community together acts like a private investor while at the same expanding LunarDAO Squad wealth. The shared wealth can be used to further the success of the lunarpunk mission. 

* Project X is a privacy project.
* T is the token of Project X.


### Option 1: Squad Wealth

***This is a default and prioritized option to support the growth of both: new privacy projects and LunarDAO.***

A project X has a (yet illiquid) token and asks LunarDAO for a support in the project development - a DAO investment.

If LunarDAO (the Squad) agrees with the proposal. There are two possibilities:

1. Tokens in agreed amounts are transferred: T from wallet X to LunarDAO treasury wallet and support investment from LunarDAO to wallet X.

2. Project X does not have any token yet (not even illiquid). Project X and LunarDAO make an explicit agreement on all the mentioned points and an NFT (which can be seen as a bond) representing the agreed amount and price of token T in the determined future. The abovementioned NFT is transfered to LunarDAO and agreed amount of tokens of support to the project X wallet.

In both ways of option #1 100% of token T or its NFT future representation becomes part of LunarDAO treasury - a squad wealth. And as with any other assets and value of the LunarDAO squad - the DAO decides how to manage it.


### Option 2: Launchpad

***This option is not preferable as it does not fully align with the mission of LunarDAO, to create squad wealth***

In some cases the Squad may want to protect it's treasury, but still support the project through a raise. There are different possibilities how to execute a community or a squad raise:

1. An agreement is made for a limited amount of T tokens and the price is determined by the sale event. That can be done via a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool or in a same way like the LUNAR Genesis Community Sale Event - a pool locked for several days with a valuation in the end.
2. An agreement is made on a fixed price of T with an aim of total amount raised. One of the obejectives of the community sale is to ensure as optimal distribution as possible with a priority given to the community members with the skin in the game (the Squad), and to prevent by-walkers to FOMO in before. VOX token functions as a white-list ticket. Those who aquired VOX are snapshotted and whitelisted to participate in the launchpad.
3. Based on submitted LIP and a vote, the amount and price of T is fixed. Whenever a community member invest to support project X, an NFT is minted, which tracks down the amount invested. When the T is launched, a time frame opens in which the NFT is redeemable for T at fixed price and amount recorded in the NFT. The priority white-list works same way like in the point 2.

In option 2, LunarDAO provides the platform and ensures the sale happens based on agreed conditions, LunarDAO take 3% fees from the collected raise as well as the offered T token of project X. This fee is allocated to the treasury.

In both options: All the conditions as well as the option of support, token T distribution and any other particularities concerning the investment must be clearly defined before the vote. That is done by a shared input from the author of the submitted investment LIP, project X team, the Squad and the Research committee evaluation. Most importantly - the proposal is accepted only by a successful voting (read [Governance](./governance.md)).

The volume of the support by LunarDAO represents the conviction of the community in the project. The community together (particularly the Squad) acts like a private investor and acculumate the squad wealth in their treasury, which can be further used for the lunarpunk mission success.
