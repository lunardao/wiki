**Solutions**

* No private presale - no VCs involved!
* Genesis Community Sale -  Fixed amount (40% of total supply) of $LUNAR is offered for sale. The auction is done via 5 days locked Liquidity bootstrapping pool. Anyone can invest any amount of ETH. In the end of the auction, everyone who participated will recieve $LUNAR for the same price. Depending on the ending valuation of the auction (see Initial Allocation). 90% collected ETH are allocated into the LunarDAO treasury and 10% to Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) - a liquidity providing pool managed by the LunarDAO Squad and collecting rewards to LunarDAO treasury and all the LP providing stakers. These funds are locked in the POL for for 2 years.
* $VOX airdrop - Everyone participating in the Genesis sale event is airdopped $VOX. This gives advantages as it marks the initial LunarDAO Squad memership.
