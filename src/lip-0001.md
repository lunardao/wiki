# LIP-0001

LIP stands for LunarDAO Improvement Proposal. The LIP document is the primary mechanism to inform LunarDAO community about new proposals. These LIPs may propose changes in governance, guidelines, or rules and serve as the main reference for investment decisions. The LIP is a concise, explicit and technical specification on how to submit a proposal. Squad members (owners of $VOX/Shares) can submit an LIP. The current LIP template is LIP-0001, which include the content below. In the future this might change as the Squad offers new proposals.

## LIP Categories & Types

*Note: LunarDAO is based on Moloch V3 DAO primitive, launching on DAOhaus frontend. The UI by default has proposals divided into 'Basic' and 'Advanced' types. This is a generic DAOhaus setup to help users understand the proposal complexity.* 

LunarDAO proposals have two categories: *Governance* and *Investment*. If a squad member wants to submit an LIP, which does not concern funds, it is a *Governance* category. LIP concerning funds is an *Investment* category. The LIP types are listed below each category:

**Governance:** 

- Signal request  
- Update Governance Settings
- Update Token Settings
- Add Shaman
- Remove a Member  
- Multicall proposal builder
- Add Steward

**Investment:** 

- DAO Token request
- DAO Token Swap
- ERC-20 Token Transfer
- Network Token Transfer
- Use Wallet Connect

## LIP status

- **Proposal:** The LIP is shared on the forum and a discussion in the community is initiated. The author can share perspectives and motivations for the proposal with the community and answer questions. The author will develop the proposal based on community's feedback.  
- **Accepted:** 50% + 1 $VOX of the voting amount is needed for a proposal to be approved. An accepted proposal which concern treasury can be directly executed. If it's unrelated to treasury, the decision will be implemented by the responsible committee, and is coordinated by Stewards.  
- **Rejected:** If less than 50% + 1 $VOX of the voting amount vote yes, or the Sentinels based on given criteria deem the proposal to be malicious, the proposal is rejected. 

If LunarDAO Community and Squad members have expressed criticisms and evaluated the proposal to be non-aligned with community sentiment, or unsupported, the author should consider re-writing the LIP or decide not to proceed to voting.

## Voting

**The following steps are needed before proceeding to voting:**

- Submit the finalized LIP, including the date and time of the vote.  
- Update status and vote date in the header.  
- The sponsorship threshold is (a minimum number of $VOX) 10 $VOX (0.1 ETH at launch) is required to submit a proposal. This deposit is returned when the proposal have been accepted or rejected.  
- Anyone else can submit a proposal by acquiring a sponsorship by offering a fee of 0.2 ETH which is non refundable and will be sent to the DAO treasury.
- The vote is open for 72h, after which there will be a grace period of 72h when any member can ragequit if they disagree with the outcome of the vote.  
- 50% + 1 $VOX of the voting amount is needed for a proposal to be approved, otherwise the proposal is rejected.

## Template for proposals

**Every LIP draft should contain these parts:**

- **Header:** Includes title, LIP category & type, contact, date, status, vote date. The status and voting date must be updated on the final version of LIP.

**Summary:** A short description of the proposal. Reference to previous proposals.

Some LIPs will be continuously developed, such as LIP-0001. In these cases, for transparency and context, the author can write a reference to the previously accepted proposal by using the LIP number.

**Problem:** Describe why the proposal is needed.

**Solution:** Describe the proposal and what solutions it will bring for lunarpunk communities.

**Implementation:** What resources or action is needed to be able to implement the proposal.

**Community input:** The final version of the LIP, before voting, must also contain a link to community discussions on the proposal.

An LIP which is type *Investment*, afforementioned, also needs to include the following:

- Value to the ecosystem (knowledge, tools etc).  
- Requested size of support in terms of USD.  
- Offered amount of X tokens (if the project is monetary based).  
- Time period needed for execution or expected time of launch (when Token becomes liquid).  
- Is team X supported by private investors or VCs, other DAOs (or plans to) or just LunarDAO?  
- If yes: In which size and what is the price of token T to other supporting subjects?  
- If project X is token based: detail T tokenomics.  
- Wallet address to receive the support.

## Style

- The LIP shall be written in Markdown format.  
- Contact refers to the authors nick on the [community forum](forum.lunardao.net), Discourse.
