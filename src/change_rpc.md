**4) Add information for Custom RPC**

The custom RPC is mostly using the same information as Etherum mainnet. What we change is the *Network name* which can be any name and is visible to the user on their own account 
and *New RPC URL*. In *New RPC URL* we write the TRUSTED new endpoint. Because we want to change the RPC for Etherum; *Chain ID*, *Currency symbol* and *Block explorer URL* remain 
the same. Paraleln√≠ Polis is offering the community to use their endpoint https://bordel.xyz.
