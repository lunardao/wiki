# Committees

Committees in LunarDAO are groups within the community that aim to facilitate and coordinate the works of the DAO according to their specific focus. The committees presented below were chosen during the intial development because they are fundamental to the DAO. At any point, after the launch, new committees can be proposed or an existing one can be archived if the community deems it's needed (this operation is also done through LIP and voting). 

The committees autonomously decide who can join. In every committee there is one person responsible for communication, who can be contacted if a member wants to get engaged. The committees decide their own work flow and formulate expectations, objectives and key results within the committee. 

All committees give information about the ongoing works in the community meetings and are receptive to input and criticisms. Every three months each committee will submit a report to the community about the ongoing works.

## Stewards

LunarDAO Stewards (LunarDAO core team) is a committee dedicated to support and guide the essential works of the DAO. Initially, at launch, they include founding members of the DAO. The number of Stewards should not be less than three and no more than ten. The LunarDAO Stewards responsibilities includes, but are not limited to:

- Operations
- Administration
- Community management  
- Information: Making sure all other DAO members are aware of proposals and are notified in time to be able to participate in voting  
- Implementation of community decisions  
- Investment communication & coordination
- Partnerships & Networking
- Legal advice coordination
- Media & Presentation

Stewards have a separated 3/6 multisig for their operation. Fees of 0.25% from tribute and 0.5% per executed investment are sent to this wallet. Any other funding and budget has to be proposed via investment LIP and voted upon as any other proposal. Stewards' wallet: [0xab501a8eb58c9780eb04d683feb504fce391a2dd](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab501a8eb58c9780eb04d683feb504fce391a2dd)

### How to become a Steward

To become a Steward any member can write an LIP and propose to join. This follows the same governance process as any other LIP, steps are shared in [LIP-0001](https://github.com/lunardao/lip/blob/main/lip-0001.md). The proposal can include interests, experiences as well as expected level of commitment within the DAO, ideas and suggestions which can support LunarDAO mission as well as initiatives and activity of the member within the community.

## Media

The Media committee is responsible for updating the web page and twitter. The media output is in accordance with LunarDAO mission, decisions and development. The committee can also coordinate and recruit members for media productions based on LunarDAOs mission and goals, participate in interviews or initiate media works that are beneficial to the DAO. Community members can post on the [forum](https://forum.lunardao.net) if they want to join the Media committee.

## Research

The Research committee conveys research about privacy and anonymity projects and tools. This research can serve as a basis for evaluation of investment LIPs for the DAO and as a resource for the community. Community members can post on the [forum](https://forum.lunardao.net) if they want to join the Research committee.

## Education

Education is fundamental in the struggle for free life, autonomy, and community. It is vital to train guides by providing knowledge, skills and build confidence. LunarDAO is in a trust based partnership with [Adalan Academy](https://adalanacademy.org) and aim to support their development. The initial focus of this decentralized virtual academy is to offer courses in programming, economics and political philosophy. Some of the outcomes are creation and translation of education material, texts and resources. The long-term objective is being able to educate the new generation of lunarpunks.

An essential part of education, and included in the roadmap, is collecting, researching and sharing tools and resources that are privacy oriented. This includes creating [opt out manuals](https://wiki.lunardao.net/intro.html) that provide the means to exit surveillance society and develop parallel structures that are decentralized and expands our freedom. 

## Sentinels

LunarDAO Sentinels is a committee with a role of a treasury veto agent. It is a multi-sig Gnosis Safe with eight members in total. The DAO flow of proposal, vote, and execution is done fully on-chain and without any interaction or approval needed by Sentinels. However, the Sentinels are the last fall back solution as they can reject a malicious proposal even if it has been approved by the community. Five are needed to execute a decision.

*A malicious proposal can include:*

- Proposals which are harmful to LunarDAO mission and goals.  
- Proposals which are supporting centralization and hegemony.  
- Proposals which are supporting surveillance projects or measures.  
- Proposals which are supporting regulatory measures.  
- Proposal which are suspected of/or exposed as having malintent ie. a quickly pushed proposals which aims to drain the treasury.

If Sentinels reject a proposal, they are expected to share a report which include the motivation for this decision before the next community meeting after the event. The decision and content of the mentioned report will be included, discussed and evaluated in this meeting.

The suggested time frame to be a multi-sig participant is two years. The transfer will happen when there is someone who can take over when the time is due and is not a rigid measurement. To rotate responsibilities to new Sentinels supports a level of diversity of thought in this important governance responsibility. 

As a part of the [roadmap](https://lunardao.net/roadmap.html) the squad will vote if to continue to have a multi-sig based treasury or move to a complete trustless setup after the DAO launches.

**Sentinel members**

Builders and teams in our ecosystem of privacy oriented projects are often public, using known pseudonyms, and are recognized in crypto communities. In [*'Why anon'*](https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html) we explained why anonymity and privacy are not only important for lunarpunk movement, but also the only choice for the [Stewards](https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html#stewards) (core team/ founders) of LunarDAO.

To build trust, and decentralize, the DAO is collborating with six Sentinels who are not core-members. The Sentinels are:

1. [Mario Havel](https://twitter.com/TMIYChao); [Bordel hackerspace](https://bordel.paralelnipolis.cz/#/), [Paraleln√≠ polis](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/en/o-nas/).

2. [Mykola Siusko](https://twitter.com/nicksvyaznoy); [Web3 privacy now](https://t.co/doFHV0yQj5), [Pagency framework](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/tree/main/Pagency).

3. [CR1337](https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337); [Navcoin](https://twitter.com/Navcoin), [Scala](https://twitter.com/scalaHQ).

4. [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan); [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild).

5. [bZ](https://twitter.com/bZ404); [AssangeDAO](https://twitter.com/AssangeDAO).

6. [Yves Edwards](https://twitter.com/yvesedwards); [FIAT LUX Podcast](https://inv.riverside.rocks/channel/UCbZFDgaRe-tEkE77aDQJuvQ).

7. [Steward Anon 1](https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad); [LunarDAO](https://lunardao.net/).

8. [Steward Anon 2](https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad); [LunarDAO](https://lunardao.net/).

These are guidelines to support Sentinels in their responsibility. It is the responsibility of the whole community to support the governance process, in which the forum discussion is an essential part. This ensures democratic governance and gives opportunities for feedback on proposals before initiating voting. Through the LIP process, if LunarDAO Community and Squad members have expressed criticisms and evaluated a proposal to be non-aligned with community sentiment or otherwise unsupported, the author should consider re-writing the LIP or decide to not proceed with voting.
