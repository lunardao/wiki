# tau

There are plenty of task manager apps running in the web-browser, on Adroid etc. LunarDAO seeks for solutions which are open-source (GPL), distributed, working and preferably minimalistic.

Searching for task manager that fits these parameters within lunarpunk movement we found [Tau](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/misc/tau.html). Due to some complications on deployment of the current version, we decided to run the simplier Python version [Tau2](https://github.com/narodnik/tau2) as our task management.
