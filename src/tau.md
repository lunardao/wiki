# Decentralized tau

There are plenty of task manager apps running in the web-browser, on Android etc. LunarDAO seeks for solutions which are open-source (GPL), distributed, working and minimalistic.

While searching for a task manager that fits these parameters within lunarpunk movement we found tau. The first version of tau was a centralized solution and DarkFi developed 
a decentralized tau: [https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/misc/tau.html](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/misc/tau.html).
