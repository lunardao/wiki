# Staking $LUNAR

*NOTE: Please read [Current state](./update.md) before continuing reading **Tokenomics.***

Simple staking - Mechanics and rewards:

* 50% of all $LUNAR emission are allocated as staking rewards. Those are every 24h divided between all staked $LUNAR tokens (their holders proportionally). 
* Non-vested staking pool allows for $LUNAR holders to stake and unstake at anytime and earn the given APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
* Locked Staking Pools: allow to earn $VOX (the voting token) and gives higher APR ratio. $LUNAR tokens can be locked in pools from 7 days to 2 years. 
* The longer period of staking, the more $VOX for the staker, the higher the APR ratio. The more $LUNAR locked, the smaller the circulating value, higher the scarcity and the price.
