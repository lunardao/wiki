# Tokenomics

The design puts an emphasis on anonymity combined with permissionless entry for the initial Squad formation. Both are essential for a privacy oriented investment fund which aims to develop infrastructure for parallel economy.

Based on the discussions with the allies & the community, the most feasible way for the LunarDAO architecture to meet its aim, was decided to be [MolochDAO V3](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal) model. The contracts have much more optionality on both the initial setup and throughout the DAO life time in comparison to Moloch V2. V3 is also easier to set up and launch upon, possibly using existing UI and implement changes on the fly, in a more democratic manner (based on community discussions and squad vote).

## Terminology

For full description read Governance above.

- Community: Anyone engaging on the forum & chats. To be a member of the community does NOT grant voting/governance power.  
- Squad: DAO members holding shares, voting power.  
- Sentinels: Eight guardians ([multi-sig](https://lunardao.net/sentinel-committee-announcement.html)) of the DAO treasury.  
- Stewards: [Anonymous](https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html) core-team/founders of the DAO, securing operations (can be exchanged, archived, scaled up).  
Committees: Working groups with a specific focus (research, media, education).

## General

Every point marked with * symbol is to be further evaluated and decided upon by the initial LunarDAO Squad formed by all participants of the first launch, also referred to as a Genesis event.

**Setup**

- LunarDAO is setup on top of the [Gnosis safe multi-sig](https://lunardao.net/sentinel-committee-announcement.html). The DAO start with a trusted (and more secure) setup and plan a roadmap milestone to discuss, propose (LIP) and vote on a multi-sig removal in a forseeable future -> full trustless setup. *  
- LunarDAO is launched on existing [contracts](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal) and customized version of the [UI by DAOhaus](https://summon.daohaus.fun).  
- The architecture include a Shaman with Permission 3: pause, mint, burn shares and loot without DAO proposal. Governor permission not preferred as changes are based on LIP.  
- Further upgrades and customization will be discussed in the community and voted upon by the Squad.*

**Joining the DAO**

- LunarDAO launch is permissionless in the sense that anyone can join/invest.  
- Members can join only during period of the fundraising events.  
- A minimum tribute to join is 0.1 ETH (10 shares)*  
- The initial fundraising event is the launch of LunarDAO and will be opened for a period of two weeks.

**Governance Token**

In LunarDAO Shares are represented by the symbol $VOX.

- 1 $VOX is an equivalent to 1 share.  
- $VOX is LunarDAO governance token.  
- Minimum of 1 $VOX grants squad membership and voting power.  
- $VOX is an account bound, non-transferable token.  
- Every 0.1 ETH of tribute to treasury mints 10 $VOX to the member (at launch, future entry price may differ based on the previous investments made).  
- When a member ragequits the, $VOX is burned.  
- $VOX value in the treasury stays the same for remaining members.  
- RageQuitting member gets 100% of their funds in the form of loot.

**LunarDAO Loot**

Loot represents members' value of shares after RageQuit or GuildKick.

- Symbol $VOX-loot represents loot.*  
- $VOX-loot does not grant voting power.  
- $LUNAR (community) token is not introduced at launch. It will be designed and introduced as part of the roadmap.*

**Fundraising Events**

- A fundraising event is proposed to take place 4x in the first year. (every third month).*  
- An investment deal is expected to happen at least once before between each fundraisiong event.*  
- If there are still unused ETH (or DAI) from the previous raise, the number of fundraising events or max cap of such event will be adjusted to this reality. *  
- The fundraising is open two weeks the first time, and thereafter a week on each occation.*  
- During this time anyone can become a Squad member by tributing ETH to the treasury.*

**LunarDAO Operation Costs**

- LunarDAO has 6 [Stewards](./stewards.md) (core-team members, founders) at the time of launch.  
- Several externals are supporting with design, administration, legal questions, web3 development and translations.  
- A management/admin fee of 0.5% is sent to core-team multi-sig wallet (ETH: 0xAb501a8Eb58c9780eb04D683feB504fcE391A2DD). This fee is calculated from:  
a) The initial tribute of every new member.  
b) With execution of every investment.  
To fund further expences and costs an LIP is submitted and voted upon.
