# Option 2: Launchpad

*NOTE: Please read [Current state](./update.md) before continuing reading **Tokenomics.***

***This option is not preferable as it does not fully align with the mission of LunarDAO, to create squad wealth***

In some cases the Squad may want to protect it's treasury, but still support the project through a raise. There are different possibilities how to execute a community or a squad raise:

1. An agreement is made for a limited amount of T tokens and the price is determined by the sale event. That can be done via a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool or in a same way like the LUNAR Genesis Community Sale Event - a pool locked for several days with a valuation in the end.
2. An agreement is made on a fixed price of T with an aim of total amount raised. One of the obejectives of the community sale is to ensure as optimal distribution as possible with a priority given to the community members with the skin in the game (the Squad), and to prevent by-walkers to FOMO in before. VOX token functions as a white-list ticket. Those who aquired VOX are snapshotted and whitelisted to participate in the launchpad.
3. Based on submitted LIP and a vote, the amount and price of T is fixed. Whenever a community member invest to support project X, an NFT is minted, which tracks down the amount invested. When the T is launched, a time frame opens in which the NFT is redeemable for T at fixed price and amount recorded in the NFT. The priority white-list works same way like in the point 2.

In option 2, LunarDAO provides the platform and ensures the sale happens based on agreed conditions, LunarDAO take 3% fees from the collected raise as well as the offered T token of project X. This fee is allocated to the treasury.


In both options: All the conditions as well as the option of support, token T distribution and any other particularities concerning the investment must be clearly defined before the vote. That is done by a shared input from the author of the submitted investment LIP, project X team, the Squad and the Research committee evaluation. Most importantly - the proposal is accepted only by a successful voting (read [Governance](./governance.md)).

The volume of the support by LunarDAO represents the conviction of the community in the project. The community together (particularly the Squad) acts like a private investor and acculumate the squad wealth in their treasury, which can be further used for the lunarpunk mission success.
