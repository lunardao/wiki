# Governance process

- LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal): A proposal is created using the template in LIP-0001.  
- Forum discussions: A thread is created on the forum, where the LIP can be discussed. The time frame for the community to give input shall be at least one week.  
- Voting: announced at least 7 days beforehand, open 72h for voting, one week Grace period.  
- If treasury related -> multi-sig.  
- If treasury unrelated -> update documents, put in practice.

The LunarDAO governance is not limited to LIPs or voting, decisions are also made in the community or committee meetings. Voting in LunarDAO is the practical implementation of the willpower of the community. The decision making process is not something technical and cannot be separated from our communication/interaction on the forum and on ircd. It is important to always seek discussion and encourage diversity in opinions within the community. This will aid our development in building a truly decentralized, anonymous and antifragile organization.
