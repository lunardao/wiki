# Stewards

The number of Stewards should not be less than three and no more than ten. The LunarDAO Stewards responsibilities includes, but are not limited to:

- Operations  
- Administration  
- Community management  
- Information: Making sure all other DAO members are aware of proposals and are notified in time to be able to participate in voting  
- Implementation of community decisions  
- Investment communication & coordination  
- Media & Presentation  
- Partnerships & Networking  
- Legal advice coordination

## How to become a Steward

To become a Steward any Squad member can make a proposal and contact one of the [forum moderators](https://forum.lunardao.net/t/welcome-to-lunardao/7). The proposal can include interests, experiences as well as expected level of commitment within the DAO. The proposition will be discussed among existing Stewards. They will also take into consideration ideas and suggestions which can support LunarDAO mission as well as initiatives and activity of the member within the community. The Stewards may also make a call out for new Stewards if additional support is needed.
