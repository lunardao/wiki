# Current status

LunarDAO architecture, governance and tokenomics, are currently being discussed and developed by the community. 

Tokenomics v1 was rejected and the feeback from the community is the foundation for v2 proposal.

All parts of the tokenomics included in the wiki belong to the old version (v1), which remain as a reference for the discussion. 

The current proposal can be found here: [https://github.com/lunardao/dao](https://github.com/lunardao/dao )
