LunarDAO architecture (governance and tokenomics) is currently being discussed and developed by the core-team and the community. Tokenomics v1 was rejected and the feeback from the community is the foundation for v2 proposal.
The version below is the old version(v1), which serves as a reference for the discussion. 

The current proposal can be found here: [https://github.com/lunardao/dao](https://github.com/lunardao/dao )
