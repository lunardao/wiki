# Mechanics

* $LUNAR can be staked in single asset pools or to provide liquidity (read [staking](./staking_liquidity_rewards.md) below)
* 50% of $LUNAR emissions after the genesis event are for mining rewards
* For any $LUNAR staked in a single staking or LP pools, for 7 and more days, $VOX get minted. When $LUNAR is unstaked, $VOX is burned.
* $VOX supply is tied to staked $LUNAR tokens and the staking period. All $VOX in existence = 100% existing votes
* To approve a proposal 50% + 1 $VOX from the voting amount is needed as a minimum to vote "YES"
* Any $LUNAR tokens outside of the locked staking pools are not eligable for voting as they do not return $VOX to their holders
