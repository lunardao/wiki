# $VOX Airdrop
$VOX token is minted when staking $LUNAR. It allows its holder to submit a LIP and to vote in LunarDAO. $VOX will be airdropped to everyone participating in LunarDAO Genesis Community sale event.

## Objectives

$VOX airdrop during the Genesis Event has 2 objectives:

1. Create LunarDAO Squad - Give initial members a way to vote based on the intial support before the staking option (earning $VOX the normal way) is established.
2. Reward initial members with a gift of a governance token which they will have forever (regardless staking $LUNAR)

## $VOX Price

$VOX is as an account bound token which cannot be transferred, nor purchased on the market. It's amount, hence value, is derived from amount and time period of staked $LUNAR.

**$VOX ratio per 1000 $LUNAR per time locking period**

| **Staking Pool** | **$VOX / 1000 $LUNAR** |
| --- | --- |
| 0 days | 0 |
| 7 days | 0.02 |
| 30 days | 0.08 |
| 90 days | 0.25 |
| 180 days | 0.5 |
| 365 days | 1 |
| 2 years | 2 |

$LUNAR value against USD will change, therefore $VOX valuation against USD will change. $VOX valuation to $LUNAR and time locking period is constant. That's why we need to refer to $VOX and $LUNAR relation and not to USD.

## $VOX Airdop Calculation

* The amount of ETH raised during the Community Genesis Event may vary greatly and cannot be anticipated. 
* The amount of $LUNAR distributed at this event is fixed: 40% of the total supply (while 50% stays locked).
	- 40% of 1b (total and max supply) is 400000000 $LUNAR tokens
* The size of $VOX airdop is 10000 $VOX tokens
	- 400000000 / 10000 = 40000.0
* 1 $VOX will be airdropped per each 40000 $LUNAR purchased in the Community Genesis Sale.

## VOX distribution

* Every initial member recieves $VOX at better ratio than 1 week staking per each $LUNAR - without the need to stake.
* $VOX tokens earned in the Community Genesis Sale will stay with the owner forever
* LunarDAO (LIP + vote) can decide on an event for initial members only - where a whitelist will be to burn $VOX.
* $VOX airdrop is exclusively for Community Genesis Sale event participants! Stewards or any other committees getting a small allocation of $LUNAR (such as Research & Education committee) will not recieve any $VOX airdrop.
