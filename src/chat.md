NSA was collecting the telephone records of tens of millions of Americans, collected and stored 200 million text messages per day. NSA directly accessed servers of nine internet firms, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, to track online communication in a surveillance programme known as Prism. They also bugged Eurpean Union offices, and surveilled Japan, South Korea and India, Brazil and Mexico. These are only few examples.

It is also criticized fo violating the basic human right to privacy.
