# Option 1: Squad Wealth

*NOTE: Please read [Current state](./update.md) before continuing reading **Tokenomics.***

***This is a default and prioritized option to support the growth of both: new privacy projects and LunarDAO.***

A project X has a (yet illiquid) token and asks LunarDAO for a support in the project development - a DAO investment.

If LunarDAO (the Squad) agrees with the proposal. There are two possibilites:

1. Tokens in agreed amounts are transfered: T from wallet X to LunarDAO treasury wallet and support investment from LunarDAO to wallet X.

2. Project X does not have any token yet (not even illiquid). Project X and LunarDAO make an explicit agreement on all the mentioned points and an NFT (which can be seen as a bond) representing the agreed amount and price of token T in the determined future. The abovementioned NFT is transfered to LunarDAO and agreed amount of tokens of support to the project X wallet.

In both ways of option #1 100% of token T or its NFT future representation becomes part of LunarDAO treasury - a squad wealth. And as with any other assets and value of the LunarDAO squad - the DAO decides how to manage it.
