One of these projects was ['Scribbles' project](https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Scribbles), a document-watermarking system for documents that are likely to be copied by Insiders, Whistleblowers, Journalists or others - in order to track those who freely try to share about surveillance programs and attacks on our privacy.

Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, has been imprisoned in Belmarsh High Security Prison for 5 years. The UK government ordered his extradiction to US in June 2022. The extradiction hasn't been executed yet due to appeals although the first was rejected by UK high court. In US Assange will face charges of espionage and even though the US has assured that no death penalty would not be imposed should he be convicted, he would face life imprisonment.
